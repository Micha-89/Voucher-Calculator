# Voucher-Calculator

This is my first ever JavaScript application that I built last summer. 

The main goal was to put my, at that time, basic JavaScript skills and DOM manipulation into practice. I also used bootstrapt to create the dropdown navbar.

I built this application to use in my previous job as a customer service agent. 

It calculates proportionaly how much of a voucher you need to refund per specific product in an order. 

You can check it out [here](https://voucher-calculator.vercel.app/).
